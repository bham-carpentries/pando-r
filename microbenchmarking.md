## Introduction

Microbenchmarking measures the performance of a very small piece of code, 
typically something that might take milliseconds (ms), microseconds (μs) or nanoseconds (ns), where, if a microbenchmark takes:

- 1 ms, then one thousand calls take a second.
- 1 µs, then one million calls take a second.
- 1 ns, then one billion calls take a second.

In R, the package [**bench**](https://bench.r-lib.org/) uses a high precision timer, making it possible to compare the speed of operations that run extremely quickly.

## Using the bench package

### `bench::mark()`

We can use the `bench::mark()` function to compare approaches to solving the same problem, e.g. finding the square roots of a vector of numbers:


``` r
x <- runif(1000)
sqrt_bench <- bench::mark(
  sqrt(x),
  x ^ 0.5
)

sqrt_bench
```

``` output
# A tibble: 2 × 6
  expression      min   median `itr/sec` mem_alloc `gc/sec`
  <bch:expr> <bch:tm> <bch:tm>     <dbl> <bch:byt>    <dbl>
1 sqrt(x)      8.46µs     12µs    79385.    7.86KB     7.94
2 x^0.5       19.09µs   19.4µs    47529.    7.86KB     9.51
```

By default, `bench::mark()` runs each expression enough times to take 0.5 seconds. 
It also checks that each run returns the same value. 

`bench::mark()` returns results as a tibble, with one row per expression. Although the print version of `sqrt_bench` above only shows 6 columns, there are in-fact 13:


``` r
colnames(sqrt_bench)
```

``` output
 [1] "expression" "min"        "median"     "itr/sec"    "mem_alloc" 
 [6] "gc/sec"     "n_itr"      "n_gc"       "total_time" "result"    
[11] "memory"     "time"       "gc"        
```

- To compare time taken, the `min`, `median` and `itr/sec` (estimated number of executions performed per second) summarise the time taken by the expression, `n_itr` gives number of iterations and `total_time` gives the total time to perform the benchmarks. 
- To compare memory usage, `mem_alloc` is the total amount of memory allocated by R while running the expression, `n_gc` gives the total number of garbage collections and `gc/sec` give the number per second. 
- `result`, `memory`, `time` and `gc` are list-columns that store the underlying raw data.


We can visualise the distribution of the individual timings with `plot()`:


``` r
plot(sqrt_bench) # requires ggplot2, tidyr and ggbeeswarm to be installed 
```

``` error
Error in `ggplot2::autoplot()` at bench/R/autoplot.R:126:3:
! The package "ggbeeswarm" is required to use `type = "beeswarm".
```



:::::: discussion

## Useful columns

Which columns in the output of `bench::mark()` do you think are most useful in determining the best-performing expression? Why?

::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 


## Challenge 1

Here are two other ways to compute the square root of a vector. Of these along with the two methods already seen, how do you think they'll rank on speed? Use microbenchmarking to check your intuition.

```
x ^ (1/2)
exp(log(x) / 2)
```

:::: solution

``` r
bm <- bench::mark(
  sqrt(x),
  x ^ 0.5,
  x ^ (1 / 2),
  exp(log(x) / 2)
)

bm[order(bm$median), ]
```

``` output
# A tibble: 4 × 6
  expression         min   median `itr/sec` mem_alloc `gc/sec`
  <bch:expr>    <bch:tm> <bch:tm>     <dbl> <bch:byt>    <dbl>
1 sqrt(x)         8.46µs   9.27µs    93007.    7.86KB    18.6 
2 exp(log(x)/2)  12.55µs  12.73µs    77042.    7.86KB    15.4 
3 x^0.5           19.1µs  19.39µs    49244.    7.86KB     4.92
4 x^(1/2)        19.16µs  19.52µs    49734.    7.86KB     9.95
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::: callout
If the code is more than a single expression, create function wrappers for each alternative (the functions can also take arguments):

```
fun1 <- function() {
  # some code
}

fun2 <- function() {
  # some other code
}

bench::mark(fun1(), fun2)
```

### Scaling and `bench::press()`

Benchmarking can be difficult as the best option can depend on the size of the data, e.g. memory allocation can overshadow run time for small objects.

When thinking about how our code scales to bigger, we need to consider what we mean by "big"

- number of rows or number of columns?
- number of observations or number of factor levels?

`bench::press()` compares a function over a grid of parameters.
The parameter you want to set are given as named arguments and a grid of all possible combinations is automatically created. 
The code to benchmark is then given by one unnamed expression



``` r
bp <- bench::press(
  n = c(10, 100, 1000), 
  k = c(100, 10, 1),
  bench::mark(gl(n, k)), # gl generates factor levels 
  .quiet = TRUE # don't print progress messages
)

bp
```

``` output
# A tibble: 9 × 8
  expression     n     k      min   median `itr/sec` mem_alloc `gc/sec`
  <bch:expr> <dbl> <dbl> <bch:tm> <bch:tm>     <dbl> <bch:byt>    <dbl>
1 gl(n, k)      10   100  10.99µs  11.88µs    79230.   15.93KB    15.8 
2 gl(n, k)     100   100  78.62µs   79.9µs    12090.   81.36KB    24.9 
3 gl(n, k)    1000   100  797.5µs 815.07µs     1186.  809.06KB    26.6 
4 gl(n, k)      10    10   4.56µs   5.33µs   181575.      896B     0   
5 gl(n, k)     100    10   16.3µs  17.24µs    55815.   11.05KB    16.7 
6 gl(n, k)    1000    10 173.99µs 177.45µs     5505.  105.94KB    15.8 
7 gl(n, k)      10     1   3.82µs   4.14µs   230069.        0B     0   
8 gl(n, k)     100     1   9.82µs  10.47µs    91885.    4.02KB     9.19
9 gl(n, k)    1000     1  111.2µs 113.24µs     8595.   35.62KB     6.19
```

::::::: challenge
## Challenge 2

`gl(n, k)` generate factors by specifying the pattern of their levels, where `n` is the number of levels and `k` is the number of replications, e.g.


``` r
gl(2, 3)
```

``` output
[1] 1 1 1 2 2 2
Levels: 1 2
```

Looking at `bp` created above, increasing which of `n` or `k` has the biggest impact on the performance of `gl()`?

::: hint
You can rearrange the order of the rows (e.g. by `n` or `k` or `median`) to see patterns a different way.
